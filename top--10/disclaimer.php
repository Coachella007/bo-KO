    IN TRADING THROUGH THEINTERNET:</b>
  <p>A CFD (contract for difference) trading involves many types of contracts covering a diverse set of markets
    including shares, indices, commodities and treasuries. Forex is a de-centralized global market where the world’s
    currencies are exchanged. CFD trading and Forex are speculative and involves a high degree of risk and can result in
    the loss of your entire investment. Therefore, trading in CFD and Forex is appropriate only for persons who
    understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved in such transactions. You should
    be satisfied that CFD and Forex trading is suitable for you in light of your financial circumstances and attitude
    towards risk. You should not engage in speculative CFD and Forex trading unless you understand the basic aspects of
    such trading and its risks. If you are in any doubt as to whether CFD and Forex trading is appropriate and suitable
    for you, please seek independent advice from a financial consulting professional, as 'TOP10 Profits' does not
    provide such advice. It is the Client’s responsibility, considering his personal circumstances and financial
    resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying for
    engaging in Forex and CFD Trading with 'TOP10 Profits' and our selected brokers and prior to making any individual
    order. Where the Client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with the Company or
    in making any individual order, the Client should seek advice and consultation from an independent Financial
    Advisor. If the Client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in CFDs and Forex, the Client
    should not trade at all. You are advised that the CFDs and Forex offered by our selected brokers are not always
    traded under the rules of any recognized, designated or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in CFD and Forex
    trading may expose you to substantially greater risks than investments which are so traded. The Client must
    acknowledge that engaging in CFD and Forex poses a great risk of incurring losses and the Client must accept that he
    is willing to undertake this risk.</p><b>LEGAL RESTRICTIONS</b>
