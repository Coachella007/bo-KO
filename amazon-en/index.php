        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">A major advantage in owning Amazon stock is the company’s
                        willingness to disrupt a wide range of industries.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">Mid to long term investing can be life changing when you buy and
                        hold the truly great businesses. While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they
                        can win big.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">Don’t believe it? Then look at the Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)
                        share price. Continuing to clobber the market, at the time of writing, it’s over 450% higher
                        than it was five years ago, more than six times the S&P 500 index’s 67% return. The stock has
                        also climbed a staggering 2,220% in the past decade.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">With the continuing growth of online retail and ever-booming
                        ecommerce sector, AMZN stock has advanced so quickly in recent years that the company is worth
                        nearly $1 trillion.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans"><strong>1. Exceptional Leadership</strong><br>Like other
                        ridiculously successful Silicon Valley companies Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet
                        (GOOGL), Amazon is a founder-run company. But even compared to the enviable track records of
                        those names, Jeff Bezos’ leadership is exceptional.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">Bezos’ obsession with customer service is now a core part of
                        Amazon’s ethos – as is his ruthlessness. And if there were any doubt, Bezos is also the largest
                        single owner of Amazon stock (12%), so his interests are clearly aligned with shareholders.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">Bezos didn’t become the world’s richest person by accident – he’s
                        the single best allocator of capital in the world right now, which means he’s seldom unprepared
                        for future opportunities and challenges.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans"><strong>2. Amazon Continues to Disrupt Multiple
                            Industries</strong><br>Another advantage to owning Amazon stock is, simply put, the
                        company’s willingness, desire and ability to disrupt an extraordinary range of industries.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">Amazon.com started as a disruptor, forcing brick-and-mortar
                        booksellers out of business due to its scale, lower overhead and convenience. It didn’t take
                        long for Amazon to push from hawking books to all sorts of product categories – toys,
                        electronics, clothes, tools, you name it.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">The e-commerce giant’s ambitions continued to evolve, and in 2017
                        it surprised Wall Street by acquiring organic foods grocer Whole Foods for $13.4 billion. It
                        even offers its own branded credit card, is building out its own delivery service and is
                        considering moving seriously into retail banking.</p>

                    <p><a class="btn btn-block btn-warning font-family-merriweather text-white py-3"
                            href="#form">Discover how to benefit from investing in Amazon</a></p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans"><strong>3. Amazon Still Has A Massive Addressable
                            Market</strong><br>Amazon’s total addressable market (TAM) is the largest among all top
                        internet tech platforms. It’s estimated that Amazon’s e-commerce platform has a $20 trillion TAM
                        and is only about 10% penetrated. Amazon Cloud Services (AWS), the company’s most profitable
                        segment, has an additional $1 trillion TAM and is also only about 10% penetrated.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">In addition, Amazon has only reached about 30% penetration into a
                        $1 trillion potential advertising opportunity and 10% penetration into a $5 trillion business
                        supplies market.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans"><strong>4. Amazon Is Outcompeting Its Rivals</strong><br>With more
                        than 100 million loyal Prime subscribers, more than half of all U.S. shoppers now start their
                        search on Amazon. Amazon has about 40% share of the U.S. e-commerce market, but that share is
                        still growing. As Amazon invests in improving convenience, selection and pricing, it could and
                        probably will be extremely difficult for competitors to keep pace.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans"><strong>5. Amazon Generates Consistent Growth</strong><br>While
                        Amazon may not be generating the 40%-plus revenue growth it once was, the fact that only two of
                        Amazon’s past 66 quarters have produced organic revenue growth of less than 20% is incredibly
                        impressive. Amazon’s profitability has been inconsistent due to heavy growth investment, but it
                        has also trended consistently positively over time, averaging 21.5% revenue growth over the past
                        four quarters.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans"><strong>Amazon Stock Price Set to Skyrocket?</strong><br>Online
                        forecasting service Longforecast.com, predicts that the company’s stock will experience a
                        long-term increase, with the Amazon shares trading at $2,398 by November 2021. Another
                        forecasting service Wallet Investor has also taken a bullish stance, expecting Amazon stock to
                        trade at $3,841 by November 2024, meaning that an investment today, would see revenue at around
                        +119.37 percent in five years.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans">Gov Capital offers the most optimistic outlook of all, stating that
                        Amazon stock could reach a price of $10,720 by mid-November 2024.</p>

                    <p class="font-family-open-sans"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>So, should you buy Amazon stock
                        before this year comes to an end? Like any other form of investment, there is no guarantee of
                        success. Nevertheless, according to Amazon’s stock trend analysis and forecasts, there’s more
                        than a good chance that the company could bring substantial growth to your portfolio in the next
                        two years.</p>
